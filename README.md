Current is a product designed with three goals in mind.  

First, Current serves as a digital replacement for physical, paper business cards. At Current, we hope to modernize this classic social and professional interaction while also taking advantage of the new possibilities technology can provide in exchanging information. Space constraints, for example, are no longer a concern.   

Second, Current aims to bring context to this interaction of meeting and exchanging information. Details like time, location, and relevant notes about the exchange can be extremely helpful down the line. Online and social media presence is increasingly important to getting a full picture of a person’s identify. A static paper business card doesn’t help you recall much and is too rigid to afford these extra details, but a rich and interactive digital equivalent sets the stage for the next time you reach out.  

The third part of our product aims to create a system for organizing and managing all of these new connections, in addition to maintaining existing relationships through tasks and workflows. Essentially, Current is the best way to keep up with both your professional and person network. Professionally, it can remind you to follow up with someone if you need to schedule a meeting with them or are interested in interviewing them. Personally, it can remind you to ask a friend to dinner or call your grandma. Expanding on the idea of providing context, it will also keep a running record of your past interactions (and any relevant notes) with each contact. Current helps you grow and strengthen your inner circle.  

In a nutshell, Current makes it frictionless to make new connections and effortless to maintain them.
